# LaunchBar 6 actions

Custom actions for [LaunchBar 6](http://obdev.at/products/launchbar). Brewed myself,
juryrigged from old applescripts, or contributed by contributors!

> I no longer use LB6 so these actions will no longer be maintained, with the
> exception of tiny updates. Sorry!
>
> For whoever is interested: I am porting many of these actions over to shell
> scripts in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles).

## Installation

Download links are below.

**Do not download this repo** to install these actions. If you do
anyway, you need to run `rake` before any of the lbaction files are
ready for installation.

## Auto-updating

I recommend you also install Prenagha's
[Action Updates action](http://prenagha.github.io/launchbar/updates.html),
for auto-updating actions. All of mine are compatible with his updater.
