# LaunchBar 6 actions

Requires [LaunchBar 6](http://obdev.at/products/launchbar) and sufficient nerdiness to
use.

These were brewed myself or juryrigged from old applescripts.

Any suggestions and requests are welcome!

## Installation

To install any of these, [Download the Zip](https://github.com/hlissner/launchbar6-scripts/archive/master.zip) then double click the *.lbaction file. Viola!
