Checks downforeveryoneorjustme.com to see if a website is up or down (or if it's just
you).

You can set a list of pre-set sites to check when you run Site Status without any input:

 * Hold down ctrl while running the action to select this action's Preferences.plist
 * If downforeveryoneorjustme.com is down, it uses isitup.co.uk (which doesn't seem as
   reliable, but better than nothing)
