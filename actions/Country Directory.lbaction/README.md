# Country Directory

I always find myself wanting to know either a) the phone extension of a country, b) what
time it is there, or c) its currency code.

This gives you a directory of all the world's countries, and a few basic details about
them, including those very aforementioned things.

## TODO

* Get rid of the "Get Current Time" action that sends you to google, and bake in GMT
  offsets to calculate the time on the fly.
* The action iterates through a baked JSON database to make it an LB6 result. I'd like
  to just change the conform the baked JSON into LB6 result format instead.
