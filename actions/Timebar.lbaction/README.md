# TimeBar

Controls [TimeBar.app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timebar/id617829225). Feed it
a time string and message, like so:

* 30s Flee from Godzilla
* 5 minutes - Walk the dog
* 21d Kill Wanda's lover
* 1hr 30m - Reuminate on the meaning of life
* 2hr 25s - Go back in time

Also, you can type "stop" to stop the timer.

Note: I don't have TimeBar so I can't test this. Any feedback is appreciated!
