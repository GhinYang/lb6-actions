Use's OSX's screencapture to capture an area of the screen, save it to a temporary file,
and pass it to LaunchBar for further SendTo processing. The bundled actions don't do
the second part.

**New:** If you invoke this action with alt/option down, the image will be processed
through ImageAlpha and/or ImageOptim; if either or both are available.

A few actions that may go hand-in-hand with this one:

* [Send to Cubeupload](https://github.com/hlissner/launchbar6-scripts/tree/master/actions/Send%20to%20Cubeupload.lbaction)
* [Send to Gfycat](https://github.com/hlissner/launchbar6-scripts/tree/master/actions/Send%20to%20Gfycat.lbaction)

Note: press space while selecting the screenshot area and you can select a whole window
to capture!
