A quick wibbly wobbly, timey whimey way to look up what time it is anywhere in the
world. Feed it an address, a country, a city--whatever.

Run it without text and it will list the times of preset locations you've set in your
preferences (see below).

## Requirements

A google API key is required. You'll be prompted for it on first run. You can get it
here: https://code.google.com/apis/console

You must enable the following services:

* Geocoding API
* Time Zone API


## Preferences

If you need to change your API key, hold down alt while running the action OR modify its
Preferences.plist.

`~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Action Support/io.henrik.launchbar.TimeIn/Preferences.plist`
