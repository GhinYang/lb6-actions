# Google Chrome Tabs

Inspired by [Safari
Tabs](http://manuel.weiel.eu/private-projects/launchbar-actions/safari-tabs/), this is
a [Launchbar 6](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) action for navigating
and fuzzy searching your google chrome tabs. 

Extras:

* Works with Chromium too
* Press space on a tab to switch to it without closing Launchbar
* Press enter to switch to it and to Chrome, closing Launchbar
