# Google Chrome Tabs

Inspired by [Safari
Tabs](http://manuel.weiel.eu/private-projects/launchbar-actions/safari-tabs/), this is
a [Launchbar 6](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) action for navigating
and fuzzy searching your google chrome tabs.  Selecting one will bring the tab and
Chrome into focus.

Extras:

* Hold down shift and only the tabs in the foremost Chrome window will be listed
* Hold down ctrl and the titles and urls will be switched (so you can search the URLs
  instead)
